CrawlerDetect is a PHP class for detecting bots/crawlers/spiders via the user agent. Currently able to detect 100's of bots/spiders/crawlers.

### Installation
Run `composer require jaybizzle/crawler-detect 1.*` or add `"jaybizzle/crawler-detect" :"1.*"` to your `composer.json`.

### Usage
```PHP
use Jaybizzle\CrawlerDetect\CrawlerDetect;

$CrawlerDetect = new CrawlerDetect;

// Check the user agent of the current 'visitor'
if($CrawlerDetect->isCrawler()) {
	// true if crawler user agent detected
}

// Pass a user agent as a string
if($CrawlerDetect->isCrawler('Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Sosospider/2.0; +http://help.soso.com/webspider.htm)')) {
	// true if crawler user agent detected
}

// Output the name of the bot that matched (if any)
echo $CrawlerDetect->getMatches();
```

### Contributing
If you find a bot/spider/crawler user agent that CrawlerDetect fails to detect, please submit a pull request with the regex pattern added to the `$data` array in `Fixtures/Crawlers.php` and add the failing user agent to `tests/crawlers.txt`.

Failing that, just create an issue with the user agent you have found, and we'll take it from there :)

### Laravel Package
